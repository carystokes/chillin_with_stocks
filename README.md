# Chillin With Stocks
Chillin with Stocks provides users the ability to create stock portfolios, track performance and view portfolio and security analysis. Users must register and authenticate to access the functionality. The primary page for a portfolio shows the securities in the portfolio, the price they were purchased at and the last closing price, along with the overall gain or loss. Clicking on a stock symbol will take the user to the grading page for the security. Clicking on "Grade this portfolio" will take the user to the portfolio grading page. When a stock is entered, current statistics for that stock are gathered and it evaluated against a set of rules that I have developed to help out in picking stocks. Securities are graded on price to earnings ratio, earnings growth projections, temporal price status, market capitalization and average trading volume. All of the grades for the individual stocks contribute to the grade for the portfolio. In addition, the portfolio is graded on concentration (the number of stocks it contains), diversification across industries and weighted concentration (the percentage of the portfolio value represented by any single holding).

This application was created with Ruby on Rails. It uses React for front end tables, forms and modals. Bootstrap is used for styling and the Carousel. Devise is used for user registration and authentication. The database is PostgreSQL.
